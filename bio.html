	<h1>Maria Kim</h1>
	<p>My name is Maria Kim I grew up in Massachusetts, I am first 
	generation American, as both my parents came from South Korea. I am a 
	junior at Tufts University and a Computer Science Engineering major. 
	I became inspired to learn coding due to a short experience in a 
	high school robotics club. My interest in coding grew when I first
	learned how to use Mathlab in an introductory engineering course.
